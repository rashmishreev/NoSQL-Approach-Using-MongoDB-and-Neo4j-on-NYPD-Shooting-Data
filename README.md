[Blog](https://medium.com/@sachinsm2022/accelerating-data-analytics-with-): Analyzing and Mitigating Gun Violence: A NoSQL Database-Driven Approach Using MongoDB and Neo4j on NYPD Shooting Incident Data

### Abstract
The widespread issue of gun violence, notably in schools, is a significant concern across the United States. This project specifically concentrates on the analysis of gun violence data sourced from the City of New York via OPEN API Access. It employs NoSQL Databases like MongoDB and Neo4j to develop efficient solutions to derive insights. The ultimate goal is to enhance policing efforts and effectively diminish the occurrence of shooting incidents.

### Motivation
The emotional and societal impacts of gun violence, generating fear and adversely affecting lifestyles, motivated the project to utilize historical data to assist the NYPD in preventing and reducing such incidents on a broader scale.

### Dataset
> https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic

A comprehensive list of shooting incidents in NYC from 2006, updated quarterly and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning before publication on the NYPD website. Each entry details the event, location, time, and demographics of the suspect and victim, providing valuable information for public understanding of criminal activity.
